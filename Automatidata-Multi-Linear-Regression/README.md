This project showcase is a work in progress as I continually update and refine my projects for portfolio presentation. I'm actively working on organizing my projects and adding detailed documentation to showcase my skills effectively. Check back often to see my latest work and improvements!

## Project Summary: NYC Taxi Fare Prediction

### Overview
As part of a professional certificate program, I participated in an educational job simulation with Automatidataâ€™s data analytics team. In this simulated role, I was tasked with building a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (NYC TLC). The project aimed to replicate real-world data analytics tasks by leveraging existing data collected over a year to forecast taxi fare amounts accurately. Throughout the simulation, I progressed through key stages, including the development of an action plan, initial Python coding, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and A/B testing. With these foundational steps completed, I then focused on constructing and evaluating the regression model, gaining valuable hands-on experience in applying data science techniques to a practical business scenario.

### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the construction of a multiple linear regression model. This model will be used to predict taxi fares based on various independent variables, providing NYC TLC with valuable insights for their operations.

### Project Structure
The project is divided into three key parts:

1. **EDA & Checking Model Assumptions**
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and check for any violations of regression assumptions.
   - **Purpose:** EDA helps identify patterns, detect outliers, and understand relationships between variables, ensuring the data is suitable for model building.

2. **Model Building and Evaluation**
   - Built and evaluated a multiple linear regression model using Python.
   - **Resources:** Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to clean data, build the model, and visualize results.
   - **Outcome:** The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated based on its accuracy and ability to generalize to new data.

3. **Interpreting Model Results**
   - Analyzed the regression coefficients and model outputs to derive key insights.
   - Proposed business recommendations based on the modelâ€™s predictions, helping NYC TLC optimize their fare structures and improve revenue forecasting.

### Conclusion
This project provided valuable hands-on experience in building and evaluating a multiple linear regression model, a crucial skill for data science professionals. The insights gained from this model will assist NYC TLC in making data-driven decisions to enhance their operations. The structured approach to this activity mirrors the real-world tasks that data professionals encounter, preparing me for future challenges in the industry.
